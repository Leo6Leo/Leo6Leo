### Hi there 👋

 🔭 My name is Leo Li, currently a second year computer engineering student at University of Toronto with Artificial Intelligence Minor and Robotic Minor.

🌱 I’m currently working on IEEE UofT student branch as webmaster, contributing to both backend and frontend development.

👯 I’m into software development and hoping to design accessibility software that could help minor groups of people in our society.

🤠 I'm innovative and creative like to come up with new ideas and make them come true by using the software.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me and I will get back to you as soon as I can!
