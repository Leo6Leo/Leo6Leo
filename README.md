### Hi there 👋

 🔭 My name is Leo Li, currently an incoming third-year computer engineering student at the University of Toronto with an Artificial Intelligence Minor and Robotic Minor.

🌱 I’m currently working on the IEEE UofT student branch as the director of the Webmaster team, leading a team of 10 to contribute to both backend and frontend development.

👯 I’m into software development and hoping to design accessibility software that could help minor groups of people in our society.

🤠 I'm innovative and creative. I like to come up with new ideas and make them come true by using the software.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me and I will get back to you as soon as I can!
