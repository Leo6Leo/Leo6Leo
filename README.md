### Hey there 👋


☀️ My name is Leo Li, currently a third-year computer engineering student at the University of Toronto with Artificial Intelligence and BioEngineering Minor.

🌱 I’m currently working on IEEE UofT student branch as software director, leading a team of 10 to work on open-source projects.

👯 I’m into software development, and skillful in React.js, Redux, Django, Flask, REST, and Electron, and I am learning DevOps with AWS right now!

🤠 I'm coding to build tools for people in need, and making changes to the community around me.

💻 I have joined many hackathons: S:\HA<KS 2022 (won 2nd place), Hach The North, NewHacks, MakeUofT, UofTHacks. Check out my cool projects in my website below!
